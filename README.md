### Mission statement
**web-toolkit** is a repository of command-line tools that are aimed at
capturing, analyzing, and transforming web data. These tools are being
developed to make it easier to access various forms of information on the
web, and for the convenience of reducing any complex workload.

**Note:** While the initial toolset may not be of significant use, more
tools will be added as time goes on, and depending on their usefulness in
satisfying the mission statement.

### Contribute
